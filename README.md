## How to get Started

To get started with Seafile PHP SDK, you may either set up your own private Seafile server (```https://www.seafile.com/en/product/private_server/```) or create an account for the Seacloud
(```https://seacloud.cc```). Because the SDK is in its infancy it's highly recommended to set up a test server or create a test account.

It's not advisable to use your real server/account if you already got one.

After you created your test account continue to the next step.

## Obtain API token

```bash
mkdir ~/.seafile-php-sdk
curl -d "username=you@example.com&password=123456" https://your.seafile-server.com/api2/auth-token/ > ~/.seafile-php-sdk/api-token.json
```

Hint: if user name contains a "+" char, replace the char with "%2B" (hex ascii for "+") or ```urlencode()``` the user name altogether. Just so you know.

The file ```~/.seafile-php-sdk/api-token.json``` will look something like this:

```javascript
{"token": "your_api_token"}
```

The example script will assume a config file ```~/.seafile-php-sdk/cfg.json``` that looks like this:

```javascript
{
        "baseUri": "https://your-seafile-server.example.com",
        "testLibId": "test-library-id",
        "testLibPassword": "test-library-password"
}
```

## Installing Seafile-PHP-SDK

The recommended way to install seafile-php-sdk is through
[Composer](http://getcomposer.org).

```bash
# Install Composer
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
```

Next, run the Composer command to install the latest stable version of seafile-php-sdk:

```bash
composer.phar require rsd/seafile-php-sdk
```

After installing, you need to require Composer's autoloader:

```php
require 'vendor/autoload.php';
```

You can then later update seafile-php-sdk using composer:

 ```bash
composer.phar update
 ```

## Using Seafile PHP SDK

### Connecting to Seafile

First, you need to include the API token (see above):

```php
$tokenFile = getenv("HOME") . "/.seafile-php-sdk/api-token.json";

$token = json_decode(file_get_contents($tokenFile));

$client = new Client(
    [
        'base_uri' => 'https://your.seafile-server.com',
        'debug' => false,
        'headers' => [
            'Authorization' => 'Token ' . $token->token
        ]
    ]
);
```

### List available libraries

```php
$libraryResource = new Library($client);
$libs = $libraryResource->getAll();

foreach ($libs as $lib) {
    printf("Name: %s, ID: %s, is encrypted: %s\n", $lib->name, $lib->id, $lib->encrypted ? 'YES' : 'NO');
}
```

### List files and directories of a library

```php
$directoryResource = new Directory($client);
$lib = $libraryResource->getById('some library ID of yours');
$items = $directoryResource->getAll($lib);

foreach ($items as $item) {
    printf("%s: %s (%d bytes)\n", $item->type, $item->name, $item->size);
}
```
### Download file from unencrypted library

```php
$dir = '/'; // dir in the library
$saveTo = '/tmp/'. $item->name; // save file to this local path
$fileResource = new File($client);
$downloadResponse = $fileResource->download($lib, $item, $saveTo, $dir);
```

### Download file from encrypted library

Trying to download a file from an encrypted library without unlocking it first would
inevitably fail, so just unlock (API docs say "decrypt") the library before attempting:

```php
$success = $libraryResource->decrypt($libId, ['query' => ['password' => $password]]);
// rest is the same as 'Download file from unencrypted library', see above
```

### Upload file

```php

$fileToUpload = '/path/to/file/to/be/uploaded.zip';
$dir = '/'; // directory in the library to save the file in
$response = $fileResource->upload($lib, $fileToUpload, $dir);
$uploadedFileId = json_decode((string)$response->getBody());
```

### Update file

```php
$response = $fileResource->update($lib, $newFilename, '/');
$updatedFileId = json_decode((string)$response->getBody());
```

### Get file details

```php
$directoryItem = $fileResource->getFileDetail($lib, '/' . basename($fullFilePath));
```

### Debugging and how to enable logging of requests and responses

This example requires monolog. Log entries and Guzzle debug info will be written to stdout.

```php

$logger = new Logger('Logger');

$stack = HandlerStack::create();
$stack->push(
    Middleware::log(
        $logger,
        new MessageFormatter("{hostname} {req_header_Authorization} - {req_header_User-Agent} - [{date_common_log}] \"{method} {host}{target} HTTP/{version}\" {code} {res_header_Content-Length} req_body: {req_body} response_body: {res_body}")
    )
);

$client = new Client(
    [
        'base_uri' => 'https://your.seafile-server.com',
        'debug' => true,
        'handler' => $stack,
        'headers' => [
            'Authorization' => 'Token ' . $token->token
        ]
    ]
);
```
